### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

-

My name is Michael Ha.

ðŸŒ± I am avidly learning computer science topics and new technologies to kickstart an early career in software engineering. 

âœ¨ Some fun facts about me:
* I grew up in Jacksonville, Florida.
* I lived in New York for 10 years (Queens all the way).
* I'm a [personal trainer](https://squat.coach/)!
* I grew up on a farm!  I also studied Agricultural Sciences in college.  I am passionate about sustainability and drone use in agriculture.
* Dogs make me so happy.  I don't have a dog yet knowing I'm not ready to take care of one, but I am grateful for every opportunity to meet one in Seattle (I love that I live in a dog-friendly city).

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/westkorea/).  I would love to chat with you about coding, fitness, or anything else you might be interested in.
