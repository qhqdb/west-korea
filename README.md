### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, and welcome to my GitHub!

ðŸ”­ Currently I am working on creating a static site generator using Node.js and Materialize for quick and easy deployment of basic websites by small business owners like me.  I am also building a simple digital planner for hiking and camping called Planet Packet (built using React, socket.io, tomorrow.io, and the Hiker API).

ðŸŒ± I am avidly learning computer science topics and new technologies to kickstart an early career in software engineering. 

âœ¨ Some fun facts about me:
* I grew up in Jacksonville, Florida.
* I lived in New York for 10 years.  I miss it a lot.
* I'm a [personal trainer](https://squat.coach/).
* I grew up on a farm!  I also studied Agricultural Sciences in college.  I am passionate about sustainability and drone use in agriculture.
* Dogs bring me so much joy.  I don't have a dog yet knowing I'm not ready to take care of one, but I am grateful for every opportunity to meet one in Seattle (I love that I live in a dog-friendly city).

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/westkorea/).  I would love to chat with you about coding, fitness, or anything else you might be interested in.
